/*
 * Please follow the instructions carefully.
 * 
 * When a problem says "send 'foo' to the console that means you would write
 * 
 * 	console.log('foo');
 * 
 * I may also say "send the variable x to the console" in which case you'd write
 * 
 * 	console.log(x)
 * 
 * Note: If you have multiple variables x, y, z you can send all of them to the console like so
 * 
 * 	console.log(x, y, z)
 */


// Problem 1
// Send the following calculations to the console.
// 5 plus 5
// 5 minus 5
// 5 times 5
// 5 divided by 5



// Problem 2
	// Write a series of conditions that send one of the following responses to the console.
	// 
	// If “Dad” then “He’s going to be in trouble!”
	// If “Mom” then “No big deal.”
	// If “Me” then “No more cookies for you.”
	// If none of the above, “Johnny did it.”
	// 
	// Start by defining a variable cookieThief and assigning it one of the values above.
	// 
	// var cookieThief = 'something';
	// 
	// You can accomplish this with a series of if, if else, if else if, or a function that has return statements. Choose whichever you think works best.
	// 
	// You can review Rebecca Murphey's post on how to avoid using "else if" by going here: http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/12/10/js-conditionals/


// Problem 3
	// Look at the three Boolean conditions in the sentence below.
	// 
	// “If the day is Thursday, the time is ‘6:30 PM’ and the room is ‘HU 317’ then you are in CA276. Otherwise, you are in another class.”
	// 
	// Express this sentence as an “if” statement with the proper comparison (=== or !==) and Boolean (&& or ||) operators. You will send one of the following sentences to the console.
	// 
	// “You are in CA276”
	// “You are in another class”


// Problem 4
	// Create a variable bartSimpson and set it equal to the empty string.
	// 
	// var bartSimpson = '';
	// 
	// Write a while loop that repeatedly concatenates the string below to the variable bartSimpson: 
	// 
	// 'I will not make fun of the teacher using JavaScript code.'
	// 
	// Your loop will do this 10 times. Send only the final version of the string to the console. Do not output the string during each loop iteration.
	// 
	// Your final result will be the equivalent of saying
	// 
	// console.log('I will not make fun of the teacher using JavaScript code. I will not make fun of the teacher using JavaScript code. I will not make fun of the teacher using JavaScript code. I will not make fun of the teacher using JavaScript code. I will not make fun of the teacher using JavaScript code. I will not make fun of the teacher using JavaScript code. I will not make fun of the teacher using JavaScript code. I will not make fun of the teacher using JavaScript code. I will not make fun of the teacher using JavaScript code. I will not make fun of the teacher using JavaScript code.');
	// 
	// only you'll be writing 
	// 
	// console.log(bartSimpson);


// Problem 5
	// Do the same as you did in question 4 but write it as a for loop. A sample for loop can be found below.
